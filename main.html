	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	<P>Time complexity is the approximate runtime of our program.The code with
	lesset time complexity is more efficient than others with higher time complexity</P>

	<p>Space Complexity is the calculation of the memory required by our program.If we store array of n length then the space complexity will be O(n)</p>
